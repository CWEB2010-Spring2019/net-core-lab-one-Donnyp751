# .NET Core Quiz Program (Lab 1 - 5pts.)

You are going to build a quiz application that requires you to generate 10 questions along with 4 option choices for each question.  You will do some research on .NET Core and decide upon 10 questions that will assess the quiz taker's knowledge on .NET Core 

## Instructions

Listed below is the correct answer key for your quiz.

```bash
 1) B 	| 2) B 	| 3) C 	| 4) A 	|  5) D 	
 ------	|------	|------	|------	|-------	
 6) A 	| 7) A 	| 8) C 	| 9) D 	| 10) A 	
```
Your program should store these correct answers in an array.  (Store each question’s correct answer in an element of a String array.)  The program will iterate through each question and allow the quiz taker to enter a answers for each question, which should be stored in another array. After the student’s answers have been entered, the program should display a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam.  (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam.)  It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.

## Requirements

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
